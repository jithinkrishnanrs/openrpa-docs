# Enable OpenRPA for SAP
OpenRPA uses SAP GUI Scripting to record and do actions inside SAP.

Sap is not installed by default, you need to specefy this, when running OpenRPA.msi. If you did not install it, you can somply run OpenRPA.msi again to modify your installation.

# Enable SAP Sserver for Scripting

You can enable scripting by setting the profile parameter sapgui/user_scripting to TRUE. The value set using this procedure will be lost when the system is restarted.
Contact your administrator to make this setting enabled permenantly.
( See [screenshots here](https://winshuttle-help.s3.amazonaws.com/step-by-step/en/transaction/enable-gui-scripting.htm) )

1. Call transaction RZ11.

2. On the Maintain Profile Parameters screen, enter sapgui/user_scripting.

3. Choose Display.

4. In the Display Profile Parameter Attributes screen, choose Change value.

5. Enter TRUE in the New value field.

   - Parameter Value: TRUE
